<h1 align="center">🌾 AgriSmart</h1>
<p align="center"><b>Smart Farming Assistant • Crop to Market Guidance</b></p>

<p align="center">
AgriSmart is an <b>open-source, mobile-first agriculture platform</b> designed to guide farmers through the complete crop lifecycle — from choosing the right crop to harvesting and selling at the best price.

## 🌍 Why AgriSmart?

Farmers often rely on **fragmented, delayed, or informal information**, which leads to:

- ❌ Wrong crop selection  
- ❌ Inefficient farm operations  
- ❌ High weather-related risk  
- ❌ Low income due to poor market timing  

AgriSmart solves this by unifying **agronomy guidance, weather intelligence, and market insights** into a single, easy-to-use mobile application.

## 💡 What AgriSmart Does

AgriSmart integrates:

- 📍 **Location & land details**
- 🌱 **Soil parameters**
- 🌦️ **Weather forecasts**
- 💰 **Market & mandi prices**

to provide **clear, actionable guidance** — not raw data.

Once a crop is selected, the app generates a **stage-wise crop plan** and delivers timely advisories for every major farming activity.

Designed with an **offline-first, low-bandwidth approach**, AgriSmart supports **Indian regional languages** and is suitable for users with limited digital literacy.
